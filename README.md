This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks focused on causal inference for both experimental and observational data. Each notebook provides applied examples using simulated data.

The notebooks are organized as follows:

1. [**Selection Bias**](notebooks/Bias.ipynb): This notebook shows how selection bias arise from observational data.
2. [**CUPED**](notebooks/CUPED.ipynb): This notebook shows how to use regression adjustment and CUPED with heterogeneous treatment effects.
3. [**Multiple Randomized Designs**](notebooks/MRD.ipynb): This notebook demonstrates how to analyze marketplaces where SUTVA is violated.
4. [**Power Analysis**](notebooks/Power.ipynb): This notebook shows how to conduct power analysis for randomized experiments.
5. [**Instrumental Variables**](notebooks/IV.ipynb): IN PROGRESS
6. [**Regression Discontinuity Design**](notebooks/RDD.ipynb): IN PROGRESS
7. [**Difference-in-Differences**](notebooks/DID.ipynb): IN PROGRESS
8. [**Event Study**](notebooks/Event_Study.ipynb): IN PROGRESS
9. [**Matching**](notebooks/Matching.ipynb): IN PROGRESS
10. [**Synthetic Control**](notebooks/SC.ipynb): IN PROGRESS
