# causalml-advanced
 
This repository contains a series of Jupyter Notebooks that are based on the labs from the book [Applied Causal Inference Powered by ML and AI](https://causalml-book.org). My goal is to provide simplified versions of the labs, using the same code but different datasets.

The notebooks are organized as follows:

1. [**Selection Bias**](notebooks/Bias.ipynb): This notebook shows how selection bias arise from observational data.
2. [**CUPED**](notebooks/CUPED.ipynb): This notebook shows how to use regression adjustment with heterogeneous treatment effects.
3. [**Multiple Randomized Designs**](notebooks/MRD.ipynb): This notebook compares the treatment effects of simple and multiple randomized designs.
4. [**Power Analysis**](notebooks/Power.ipynb): This notebook shows how to conduct power analysis for randomized experiments.
5. [**Instrumental Variables**](notebooks/IV.ipynb): IN PROGRESS
6. [**Regression Discontinuity Design**](notebooks/RDD.ipynb): IN PROGRESS
7. [**Difference-in-Differences**](notebooks/DID.ipynb): IN PROGRESS
8. [**Event Study**](notebooks/Event_Study.ipynb): IN PROGRESS
9. [**Matching**](notebooks/Matching.ipynb): IN PROGRESS
10. [**Synthetic Control**](notebooks/SC.ipynb): IN PROGRESS
