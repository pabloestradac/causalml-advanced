    "### Double-sided Marketplace\n",
    "\n",
    "[Bajari et al. (2023)](https://www.amazon.science/publications/experimental-design-in-marketplaces) discuss a business scenario involving a video streaming service where viewers watch content provided by various content creators. The company is interested in understanding the impact of increasing the number of advertisements shown before the content begins (referred to as Pre-Roll Ads or PRAs) on the time viewers spend watching the content.\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific business problem is to assess the effect of doubling the number of PRAs (from one to two) on the engagement of viewers with content creators. The company needs to determine whether increasing the number of PRAs will reduce viewer engagement and how content creators might react to this change, particularly in terms of adjusting the number of ads shown during the content (Mid-Roll Ads or MRAs). You can refer to the paper for more details on MRAs and PRAs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Experimental Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "The viewer-creator pair $(i, j)$ is the unit of observation in this experiment. The outcome of interest $Y_{ij}$ is the time spent by viewer $i$ watching content from creator $j$. We are interested in the effect of doubling the number of PRAs to all viewers. This is represented by\n",

    "\\tau=\\frac{1}{I J} \\sum_{i=1}^I \\sum_{j=1}^J\\left(Y_{ij}(\\mathbf{T}) - Y_{ij}(\\mathbf{C})\\right) ,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $Y_{ij}(\\mathbf{T})$ is the potential time spent when every viewer-created pair is exposed to two PRAs, $Y_{ij}(\\mathbf{C})$ is the potential time spent when every viewer-created pair is exposed to one PRA, and $I$ and $J$ are the number of viewers and content creators, respectively.\n",

    "When full exposure $\\mathbf{T}$ is implemented, meaning the new policy of showing two PRAs is applied to all viewer-creator pairs, both direct and spillover effects occur. With the direct effect, the viewers' experience is impacted by the additional PRAs, which is expected to lead to fewer streams being watched overall. This effect is captured by a \"dispersion\" parameter, $\\delta > 0$. This triggers an indirect response from content creators: as a result of the viewers' dispersion, some content creators may choose to reduce their MRAs to lessen the impact of the increased PRAs. This response is captured by a \"premium\" parameter, $\\alpha > 0$."
